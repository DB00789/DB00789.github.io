Hi, I’m Dana, and this is where I think out loud about my academic journey.
======

I'm currently a Master's student working my way toward becoming a scientific researcher in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Coming back to academia as an older student has been both exciting and strange. I’m finding my footing again, but I’m also loving the chance to explore and try build things that might matter.

This blog is my public lab notebook. It’s where I:
- Reflect on projects from past and current classes
- Explore research ideas in-progress
- Practice writing about things I’m learning (sometimes before I fully understand them)
- Track how my interests evolve as I move through this program

Research is about exploring questions, not just answering them, so I’m giving myself permission to just put my thoughts out there. If someone else finds it useful or if it helps me see my progress over time, that’s a win. Feel free to reach out or share your thoughts. I'm happy to connect.

Thanks for visiting.
