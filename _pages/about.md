Hi, I’m Dana, and this is where I think out loud about my academic journey.
======

I'm currently a Master's student working my way toward becoming a scientific researcher in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Coming back to academia as an older student has been both exciting and strange. I’m finding my footing again, but I’m also loving the chance to explore and try build things that might matter.

This blog is my public lab notebook. It’s where I:
- Reflect on projects from past and current classes
- Explore research ideas in-progress
- Practice writing about things I’m learning (sometimes before I fully understand them)
- Track how my interests evolve as I move through this program

Research is about exploring questions, not just answering them, so I’m giving myself permission to just put my thoughts out there. If someone else finds it useful or if it helps me see my progress over time, that’s a win. Feel free to reach out or share your thoughts. I'm happy to connect.

Thanks for visiting.


Previous Lives
------
Prior to this I worked as a design consultant for Jacob Jensen Design and my own company Lines Designworks. As a consultant I worked on design strategy, digital and 3D product designs for lots of companies. For a little over a year, I ran the design and creatives teams at Flipkart.  
I earned a BFA in industrial design with a focus in interaction design at the University of Washington in Seattle. And going back little further, I was a software developer / tester at Microsoft, after finishing my BSE in industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan.
